## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - JS Framework
- [Qwik](https://nextjs.org/) - Web framework (used as integration for Astro)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It was my first project using the Astro framework, and I learned how to integrate Qwik with Astro and build a simple newsletter project. The most difficult challenge was to use Qwik in Astro because those are two separate frameworks, and they are not fully compatible, although in docs, there is Qwik integration to astro.
